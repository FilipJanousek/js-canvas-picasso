# js-canvas-picasso

Hi there! 

I created this project to try to generate automatic drawing by vectors and trigonometry. In the preview image below, you can see what a working picasso looks like after opening the src/picasso.html file.<br> 

Feel free to use my code and modify it as you see fit if you want!
